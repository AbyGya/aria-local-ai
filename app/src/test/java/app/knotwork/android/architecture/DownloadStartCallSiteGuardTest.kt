/**
 * Census of the places that start a model download — which is also where the
 * download's foreground-time budget starts over.
 *
 * **Why.** `AndroidModelDownloadManager.downloadModel` resets
 * `DownloadForegroundBudget`. That is honest only because Android resets its own
 * daily `dataSync` count at the same moment: every caller is a user action on a
 * visible screen, so the app is on screen. A download started from the
 * background — a pipeline tool, a trigger — would reset the budget while
 * Android's count kept running, and the download could run into Android's
 * limit, which crashes the app. This test fails when a new file starts a
 * download, so the new caller is looked at before it lands.
 *
 * **What it cannot see.** It matches the call as written, `.downloadModel(`. A
 * call through a function reference or a wrapper is not matched; the one
 * wrapper that exists, the Discover install use case, has its own census below.
