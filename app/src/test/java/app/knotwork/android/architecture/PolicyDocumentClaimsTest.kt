/**
 * Sentences of the privacy policy, the threat model and the bundled FAQ that the
 * code once contradicted, pinned to what the code does now.
 *
 * Each one was measured false against the tree before it was rewritten: a reader who
 * followed it would have looked in the wrong place or trusted a guarantee the app
 * does not give. The assertions look for the wrong sentence and for the fact that
 * replaced it, so a later edit cannot quietly restore the first.
 *
 * `PRIVACY.md` and `SECURITY.md` are declared inputs of the test task; the FAQ is
 * read from its bundled copy under `src/main/assets`, which recompiles the resources.
