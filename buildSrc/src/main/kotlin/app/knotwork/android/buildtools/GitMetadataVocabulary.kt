/**
 * The pure half of the git-metadata vocabulary scan: which commands to run, how
 * to read their output, and what to hand to [ForbiddenVocabularyChecker].
 *
 * `verifyForbiddenVocabulary` reads files, and it has to: a gate that decides a
 * build must be a function of the tree. But the first thing a visitor to the
 * repository reads is not a file. Branch names, commit messages and pull request
 * titles carried internal planning numbers for months while the file gate stayed
 * green: in the range between two releases, 142 of 143 commits did. This scan
 * reads that layer with the same rules — there is no second list of patterns —
 * and minus one family, [Family.INTEGRATION_BRANCH_PATH], whose number has a
 * public referent in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
 *
 * It stays out of `check` because its verdict depends on git state, not on the
 * tree. [ScanGitMetadataVocabularyTask] runs it on demand, before a pull request
 * is opened or retitled.
